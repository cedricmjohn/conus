# CoNuS
CoNuS stands for "Concurrent Numerical Simulations". As it names implies, CoNuS is a generic library for numerical modelling in Scala. It is part of the <b>Carbonate Shells</b> numerical toolset. CoNuS is currently experimental software, with active testing and coding currently in progress within <a href="http//www.carbonateresearch.com">CÃ©dric John's research group</a>.

The latest version of the library is 0.2.2, running on Scala versions 2.12 and 2.13

## Using CoNuS

### SBT

For SBT, add these lines to your SBT project definition:

```scala
resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"

libraryDependencies  ++= Seq(
  // Last  release
  "org.carbonateresearch" %% "conus" % "0.2.2"
)
```

### Jupyter Notebook with Almond.sh

The preferred and easiest way to work with forward models using CoNuS is via notebooks. We tested CoNuS with <a href="https://almond.sh/versions">Almond v.0.9.1</a>. To use CoNuS within a Jupyter Notebook with the Almond kernel, first add the following resolver:

```scala
interp.repositories() ++= Seq(coursierapi.MavenRepository.of(
"https://jitpack.io"
))
```
Then import the CoNuS library:

```scala
import $ivy. `org.carbonateresearch::conus:0.2.2`
```
All of the basic classes you need to work with stepped models can be imported with this wildcard import:

```scala
import org.carbonateresearch.conus._
```
Finally, you need to create an interface to the simulator, which is the object you will use to run your code. What interface you create depends on how you use the library. 
If you are using it from Almond, you need to create your simulator interface that way:
```scala
val sim = new AlmondSimulator
```
For any other applications, simply use the basic simulator:
```scala
val sim = new BasicSimulator
```
Once you have created a model definition, you will use your simulator interface to run and fetch results like this:
```scala
sim.evaluate(myModel)
sim.getResults(myModel)
sim.save(myModel)
```
